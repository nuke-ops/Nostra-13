      not just ones they''re hardcoded to show tweak: Contaminated now only removes
      "dangerous" gases (this is actually a consequence of the hardcode reduction)

      and adds admin logging when people open water vapor cans)'

  - rscadd: AIs can now quickly modify their status displays using an emote (*bsod)!
